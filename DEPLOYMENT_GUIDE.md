Don't delete it! Having multiple results for your name is good. Once new site ranks #1, you can retire the old one.

Track who visits and how they find you:
```html
<!-- Add to index.html <head> -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```
Get ID from: https://analytics.google.com

### 3. Create Social Profiles
- **LinkedIn**: Add portfolio link to profile
- **GitHub**: Update bio with your name and link
- **Twitter**: Create @aaryan_choudhari handle

### 4. Build Backlinks
- Write on Dev.to with your name
- Post on Hashnode
- Share on LinkedIn
- Get featured on hackathon winner lists

### Your Question:
> "Why does my old portfolio rank? Is there something different?"

**NO, your old portfolio's SEO is actually WORSE.**
