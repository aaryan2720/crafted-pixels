## What Makes Your Old Portfolio Rank

### The Real Reason:
```
Google Search → "Aaryan Choudhari" 
    ↓
Google's Index (has your old site stored)
    ↓
Returns: https://portfolioaaryan27.netlify.app
```

**It's IN the index!** That's it. That's the secret.

## What Your Old Portfolio Has:

```html
<!-- Simple but DEPLOYED -->
<title>Aaryan Choudhari | Dev Portfolio</title>
<meta name="description" content="Professional portfolio...">
<meta property="og:title" content="Aaryan Choudhari | Dev Portfolio" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://portfolioaaryan27.netlify.app" />
<meta property="og:image" content="cover2.png" />
```

**Status**: LIVE at real URL → Google indexed it → Ranks for your name ✅

---

## What Your New Portfolio Has:

```html
<!-- MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE -->
<title>Aaryan Choudhari | Software Engineer & Full Stack Developer</title>
<meta name="description" content="Award-winning Software Engineer... SIH 2025 Finalist..." />
<meta name="keywords" content="Aaryan Choudhari, Aaryan, Choudhari, Software Engineer..." />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://a-aryan-27.tech" />
<link rel="sitemap" type="application/xml" href="/sitemap.xml" />

<!-- PLUS Schema.org markup, sitemap, robots.txt, better favicon, etc. -->
```

**Status**: NOT DEPLOYED YET → Google hasn't seen it → Can't rank ❌
